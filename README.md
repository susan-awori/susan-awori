# Hello, I'm Susan Awori. 👋

### Front-End Developer | UI/UX Lover | Web Creator

I’m a front-end developer based in Nairobi, Kenya, passionate about creating interactive and user-friendly web and mobile experiences. I’m currently learning React, TypeScript, Kotlin, and Flutter to expand my skills across web and app development.  

I enjoy collaborating on open-source UI/UX and front-end projects and I'm always open to learning from others, especially about full-stack integration and app deployment.  

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about front-end development, UX design, or responsive layouts.
